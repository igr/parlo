+ Add simple answers: simple detection of qustion and returning one of the predefined answers.
+ Make a network from a story: build relations tree between sentences to emulate current context we are chatting about.
+ Add (fix) input cleanup and spellcheck error fixing.
+ Better question classification.
+ Measure!
