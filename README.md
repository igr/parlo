# Parlo

> I am not a NLP scientist! Just had couple of days to explore this wonderful subject.

**Parlo** gets the _story_ from the `data/story.txt`. Then you type the question. Top 3 matched sentences will be returned. Repeat.

This simple app is written in Java, as there are significantly less Java resources comparing to eg. Python.

## Remark

This is just scratching the surface. Many things I didn't have time to implement. I wish I could spend more time... so many ideas. Meh.

## Setup

It's Gradle, nothing required. Just first extract `data.zip` to prepare the `data` folder.
